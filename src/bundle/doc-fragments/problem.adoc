== The Problem
When writing applications that consist of a number of programs that can be executed from the command line
one will have a lot of `static void main()` methods.
Over time, it can be very hard to remember where they all are, and it is also tedious to write run scripts to start them from the command line.
The problem gets worse when code is re-factored.
Furthermore, handling options (external configuration parameters, such as via command line arguments) can involve default settings, CLI parameters, property files, other configuration files, database, etc.
