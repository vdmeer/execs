=== v0.2.0 - major changes - 2015-08-27
Complete overhaul of everything
* the executable service is not an executable application
* fixed problems in all generators (automated generation now works)
* ExecS can now identify Gen_RunScript application and push class map
* ExecS does now only do ExecS help handling and delegates all arguments to an application
* removed FigletShutdown, this class is now in skb-base
* completely new Option implementation
	** application option interface that uses default, property, CLI and potentially other value sources with generic typing and provides documentation methods
	** the interface already implements fully-automated CLI behavior, application help arguments and application version arguments
	** abstract implementation of that interface
	** set of standard option implementations (from the old CLI arguments)
* change in the CLI Parser
	** renamed ExecS_Cli to ExecS_CliParser
	** parser now can take standard options (defined by Apache Commons CLI) and the application option
	** parser does not set options outside, instead one can get the parsed command line for processing
* added some JavaDoc, but this is work-in-progress (except for overview.html)
