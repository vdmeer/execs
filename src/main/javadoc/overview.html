		A simple set of classes to execute programs from the command line with automated generation of run scripts.

		<h3>The problem</h3>
		<p>
			When writing applications that consist of a number of programs that can be executed from the command line one will have a lot of {@code static void main()} methods.
			Over time, it can be very hard to remember where they all are, and it is also tedious to write run scripts to start them from command line.
			The problem gets worse when code is refactored.
		</p>


		<h3>This solution</h3>
		<p>
			Define an interface with all required functionality to run a program (here called service).
			Then implement a class that finds implementation of that interface and that provides a single {@code static void main()} method to execute each of them.
			Combine that with a command line parser and a class finder (to search for implementations of the interface in all jars or classes in the class path, at runtime).
			Finally, add some tools that automate the generation of run scripts for the most common operating systems: Windows, UNIX, and the hybrid Cygwin.
		</p>
		<p>
			Developing an application now means to implement classes implementing the executable service interface.
			If additional functionality is required a class extending the executor.
			Finally providing the necessary configuration information for the generators and an init script for the initial configuration of the application.
		</p>


		<h3>Provided functionality</h3>

			<h4>Service Execution</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Interface for an executable service,</li>
				<li>A service executor with search and list and help functionality,</li>
				<li>A generator for a script (batch file or bash script) to run the service executor (including all required information such as class path),</li>
				<li>A generator for scripts for all registered (static) or found (dynamic) executable services,</li>
				<li>A generator for a re-base script that allows to change all required information if an application installation is moved.</li>
			</ul>

			Additionally this package defines required resources:
			<ul>
				<li>A bash script for running a generator when installing an application,</li>
				<li> A bash script for re-basing,</li>
				<li> Property files with standard configurations,</li>
				<li>String template files for flexible change of generator output.</li>
			</ul>


			<h4>Class Finder</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>A class finder that searches for implementations of the executable service interface in all jars and class files in the class path (at runtime),</li>
				<li>A package filter for the class finder to speedup the search,</li>
				<li>A jar filter for the class finder to speedup the search.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Command Line Interface (CLI)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>An implementation of a CLI parser, based on Apache Commons,</li>
				<li>A facade for the Apache Commons CLI Option (interface and abstract implementation),</li>
				<li>A number of pre-defined CLI option.</li>
			</ul>
