		<p>
			A simple set of classes to execute programs from the command line, without littering the code with <code>static void main(String[] args)</code>.
		</p>

		<p>
			This package addresses the following problem: a package (or a set of packages) contain
			a number of tools that should be run from outside java, e.g. using a <code>static main()</code> method.
			Over time, it might (will) be hard to know (or find) all main methods.
		</p>
 
		<p>
			This package provides a standard way to find and execute all those tools, or as they are called here services.
			A simple interface should be used by any component that wants to be executed.
			Implementing <code>ExecutableService</code> provides the main method <code>executeService()</code> and a method for printing a help screen.
			The only requirement is that the default constructor must be provided, to allow for a generic instantiation at runtime.
		</p>

		<p>
			The <code>CF</code> can be used to search all or filtered jar files (or URIs) for any class that implement the interface.
			Once all implementations are found, one can use the <code>ExecS</code> object with its <code>static main()</code> to execute any service from the command line.
		</p>

		<p>
			The <code>ExecS</code> class allows to list all executable services, execute one service triggering a help screen and to register short names for services.
			These short names can be used as aliases to execute a service, otherwise a fully qualified class name will be required.
		</p>

		<p>
			One can also extend the <code>ExecS</code> class to build more sophisticated versions of the execution object, to
			register specific short names or to search for other interfaces and classes in jar files at runtime.
		</p>

		<p>
			The package can also be used to automatically generate run scripts (batch files for windows or shell scripts for UNIX and Cygwin) to execute services from command line.
			The generators <code>Gen_RunScripts</code>, <code>Gen_RunSh</code>, and <code>Gen_RebaseSh</code> provide functionality for configuring the generation and will generate scripts with all required information (e.g. Java class path).
